# Garmin Cyberpunk Watchface

![Cyberpunk Watchface Preview](concept-art/cyberpunk-watch.png)

I tend not to like the watch faces that display too much data. But the Cyberpunk aesthetic makes data overload look cool.
So to show all that data and make it look good, I'm recreating the UI in one of my favorite games Cyberpunk 2077's.
This watch features an all encompasing weather widget that includes high and low temperature, weather, and chance of rain. 
The health bar includes body battery in red, stepcount in yellow, and heartrate slots in cyan. 
At the bottom you can find your current mission and which event that mission is for. 
The ring of the watch features 24 hour markers with indicators for sunrise, sunset, and moon phase. 

## TODO:

- [ ] Garmin dev ID
  - [ ] Move it into a better named folder in my `dev (/peter)` folder
  - [ ] Also store it on Google Docs incase I get a new laptop
- [ ] Install Rajdhani font and make the clockface first
